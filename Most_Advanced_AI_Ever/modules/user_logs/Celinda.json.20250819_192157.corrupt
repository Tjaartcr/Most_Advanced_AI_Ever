      "response": "At 2025-08-16 :  12:28:09 : I replied : \n \n James Bond is an iconic fictional character from British espionage literature and cinema. Debuting in the 1950s, he is portrayed as a sophisticated spy with a license to kill, operating under the code number 007. His full name, James Bond 007, reflects his elusive nature and professional dedication. The character is known for his suave style, represented by iconic elements like his Aston Martin car and preference for a martini \"shaken not stirred.\" Originally written by Ian Fleming, James Bond has evolved through various actors' interpretations, each bringing their unique depth to the role. From Sean Connery's early portrayals to Daniel Craig's more vulnerable take in later films, the character has grown to include personal complexities alongside his professional duties. The series features a recurring motif of espionage, often involving political intrigue and high-tech gadgets. Each film typically pits Bond against a new villain, with stories that blend action, adventure, and occasionally, elements of romance with \"Bond girls.\" The cultural impact of James Bond is significant, encompassing themes of British stoicism and the allure of the mystery solver. His legacy extends beyond cinema to literature and popular culture, making him an enduring figure in espionage fiction. \n \n ",

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift.

Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex: Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the cross-dressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth- century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the cross-dressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellow-green wool and thigh-reaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliat-groot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a one-eyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the child-snatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the well-known version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines: \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to re-introducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist pieter willem grobbelaar about antjie somers. this figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. over a hundred years ago, antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. this villain was said to be spotted from cape town up to the olifants river valley in the north, across southern parts of the karoo, and up to port elizabeth in the east. the warning \u2018antjie somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. according to the writer louis leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. as a foreigner, i learnt about antjie somers just several years ago, when living in south africa. i was puzzled by this character. bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. that is why some storytellers believed that antjie was a male cross-dresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. in western popular culture, cross-dresser villains are prominent. you probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as psycho or the silence of the lambs. those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in antjie somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. the audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. but i was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as khoisan, dutch or indonesian. the oral tradition suggests that the origins of antjie somers lay in ghost stories. when antjie is on the prowl, the poet hester heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. as a bane of naughty children, antjie somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. antjie somers was also associated with violent crime. in nineteenth-century legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. with his namesake, antjie winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. later,

the male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. the victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. in the variants prevalent in the netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. the same escape tactics are used by antjie somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth- century cape legends. however, in the hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the antjie somers legends, the cross-dressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. few accounts of antjie somers by khoisan descendants were recorded. those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. white people admitted that stories of antjie told by coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellow-green wool and thigh-reaching riding boots who punishes careless children. being \u2018\u2019n goliat-groot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. in another version, the bogey was a one-eyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. if imagined as a ghost, antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. this bogey is not part of the khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring antjie somers. antjie the child-snatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. his appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. in san tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as antjie somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. this sounds similar to the well-known version. antjie krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. by the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige antjie somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. children learnt about antjie from popular collections of south african literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a european witch. nowadays, antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. in afrikaans, \u2018antjie somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. like in rapport headlines: \u2018julius bloot wittes se antjie somers\u2019 or \u2018smith alweer britte se antjie somers\u2019. a few years ago, the historian fransjohan pretorius even devoted an article to re-introducing younger afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. new monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. in south africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher antjie somers is pinky pinky. this male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. i believe that antjie somers can still be useful. stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. but, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. this message is as important and empowering as ever. further details on my research: gorelik, b, \u2018cross-dresser as a bogey: on the gender ambiguity of antjie somers in south african

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male cross-dresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, cross-dresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenth-century legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex: Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded.

However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night.

The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber.

But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago.

When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

      "response": "At 2025-08-16 :  14:56:33 : I replied : \n \n Antji\u00e9 Somers is a fictional character created by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski for his Witcher series of novels and games. Antji\u00e9 is a shapeshifting witch who was born with the ability to transform into a serpent or a man. She is the main antagonist in the first novel in the series, \"War and Union,\" and later appears in subsequent novels as well as the video game adaptation of the series. In the Witcher universe, Antji\u00e9 is often described as a powerful sorceress who can manipulate time and space to her own ends. She has been called a witch by some due to her abilities, while others view her as a sorceress with great power and knowledge of magic. She is also known for being ruthless and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve her goals, even if it means betraying friends or using deception. In the video game adaptation of \"War and Union,\" Antji\u00e9's abilities are much more limited, but she is still a formidable opponent that cannot be underestimated. She is capable of shifting into her serpent form, which allows her to move quickly and silently through the dark forests of the Witcher world. However, she also has a powerful magical arsenal at her disposal, including weapons such as fireballs, ice bolts, and even blinding rays of light. Overall, Antji\u00e9 is a complex and nuanced character who embodies both good and bad qualities that make her an effective antagonist in the Witcher universe. \n \n ",

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits.

Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019.

The protagonist, named Antji\u00e9 Somers, is the son of a wealthy and powerful noble family, who has always been feared and envied by others for his looks and riches. One day, he meets a beautiful young girl named Lily, who is on her way to seek her fortune in the countryside. Antji\u00e9 is attracted to her, but when he learns that she belongs to another noble family, he vows to protect her from any harm. Antji\u00e9 tries to win Lily's hand through marriage, but her father rejects him. The young couple lives in hiding, while Antji\u00e9 tries to impress Lily with his skills as a musician and poet. In a dramatic scene, Antji\u00e9 goes into the forest by himself and sings a song to Lily, who falls deeply in love with him. However, when they are found by their enemies, they have to flee together, where they meet again at the river. The river has no bottom, but Antji\u00e9 manages to pull them both out, where they become fishes that swim across the river and end up at the house of a rich farmer who offers them his protection. Antji\u00e9 then becomes the master of this farmhouse and marries Lily after she learns that he has promised her to marry a nobleman who died in battle. The story ends with Antji\u00e9 having built a fine castle on top of the hill where they were hiding, where he lives happily ever after. The protagonist's name \"Antji\u00e9 Somers\" comes from this tale, as it means \"some rude person\". This classic Czech fairy tale is often interpreted as a reflection on the idea of nobility and its corrupting influence, while also highlighting the power of love over everything else. \n \n ",

Boris Gorelik This article was published in Afrikaans as Gorelik, B, \u2018Antjie Somers, waar kom jy vandaan?\u2019, Rapport (Johannesburg, South Africa), 21 November 2021, p 15. \u2018Die veelsydigste karakter in ons volksoorlewerings\u2019, wrote the folklorist Pieter Willem Grobbelaar about Antjie Somers. This figure was described as a town ghost, a mountain or river spirit, a legendary highway robber or a child snatcher. Over a hundred years ago, Antjie was already a bogey of children of various ethnic backgrounds. This villain was said to be spotted from Cape Town up to the Olifants River Valley in the north, across southern parts of the Karoo, and up to Port Elizabeth in the east. The warning \u2018Antjie Somers kom jou haal!\u2019 was common enough to appear in short stories, novels, fairy tales and dictionaries. According to the writer Louis Leipoldt, evoking the image of this bogey aroused \u2018juis die grieslige vrees en bangerigheid te verwek wat in daardie dae noodsaaklik geag is om 'n stout kind tot stipte onderdanigheid te bekeer\u2019. As a foreigner, I learnt about Antjie Somers just several years ago, when living in South Africa. I was puzzled by this character. Bogeys are usually described and imagined as either masculine or feminine. Antjie, on the other hand, is one of the few bogeys in the world that are portrayed as gender ambiguous. Although the character\u2019s name and clothes are feminine, the oral tradition endowed Antjie with uncannily masculine features, such as long feet, wide shoulders, thick hands and facial hair. That is why some storytellers believed that Antjie was a male crossdresser or even genderfluid, shifting between masculine and feminine at will. In Western popular culture, crossdresser villains are prominent. You probably saw them in iconic thrillers, such as Psycho or The Silence of the Lambs. Those men put on women\u2019s clothes to express their femininity, but in Antjie Somers stories, transvestism was a disguise that helped the assailant to approach his target. The audience was appalled by his betrayal of the victim\u2019s trust. Afrikaner folklorists thoroughly studied the possible historical prototypes and the array of Antjie\u2019s characteristics several decades ago. But I was surprised to learn that they did not explore the origins of this character in the stories and legends of other peoples, such as Khoisan, Dutch or Indonesian. The oral tradition suggests that the origins of Antjie Somers lay in ghost stories. When Antjie is on the prowl, the poet Hester Heese advised children, \u2018hou varkspek in jou hand en bly naby jou pa\u2019. Bacon was used to ward off evil spirits. As a bane of naughty children, Antjie Somers was often described as a malevolent spirit that descended from the mountains, lived on a beach, came out of the woods or hid behind dense bushes by the river. Indeed, bogeys in most cultures of the world are spirits or at least supernatural beings. Antjie Somers was also associated with violent crime. In nineteenthcentury legends, this character was a notorious highwayman. With his namesake, Antjie Winter, he waylaid pedestrians after dark for many years, but watchmen never managed to apprehend them. Antjie impersonated a female, particularly a frail aged woman, to approach his victim and make an assault. Later, he was described as a hitchhiker in women\u2019s apparel who lay in wait for solitary travellers (for example, a farmer returning from the market) to rob or even kill his victim with the weapon that he carried in his basket. 1 Theo Meder, a founder of the Nederlandse VolksverhalenBank, told me about an international story type featuring a transvestite robber. It is known as \u2018Test of Sex Catching an Apple\u2019. The popular motif had originated probably in the Netherlands by the mid nineteenth century, around the time when the first references to Antjie Somers were recorded. In Dutch folktales and legends, the crossdressed wrongdoer visited farms passing himself off as a woman in need of shelter for the night. His male identity was revealed when an apple was thrown into his lap. He brought his legs together, like a man, instead of spreading them to catch the fruit in his skirt. However, in Dutch folklore, the robber in women\u2019s clothes is never the main character, and he mostly remains anonymous even after his male identity is revealed. Another European folklorist, Sigrid Schmidt, established that Antjie Somers stories shared a motif with the European and American urban legends of the HairyArmed Hitchhiker. That legend evolved from stories of highway robbers disguised as women. It has circulated in the Western world at least since the early nineteenth century. The male robber appears before his potential victim in women\u2019s clothes, feigning harmlessness or even frailty, and asks for a lift. The victim soon realises that the passenger is a man with evil intentions, persuades him to leave the car for a short time under a false pretext and quickly drives off. Dutch versions of the hitchhiker legend have been documented since the nineteenth century. In the variants prevalent in the Netherlands, once the disguise is revealed, the intended victim gets rid of the robber by having him get off the carriage to open a gate or pick something up from the ground. The same escape tactics are used by Antjie Somers\u2019s targets in nineteenth century Cape legends. However, in the Hitchhiker stories, the giveaway is usually the rogue\u2019s hairy arms while in the Antjie Somers legends, the crossdressing thief arouses suspicions because of his tallness, stubble, big feet or wide shoulders. Few accounts of Antjie Somers by Khoisan descendants were recorded. Those stories were particularly rich in detail and potentially more frightening. White people admitted that stories of Antjie told by Coloureds terrified them, making that figure the scariest bogey of their childhood. Antjie was portrayed, for example, as a giantess in a loose chequered gown, a calico dress, a shawl of yellowgreen wool and thighreaching riding boots who punishes careless children. Being \u2018\u2019n Goliatgroot nooi\u2019, she had pockets large enough to accommodate a naughty child. In another version, the bogey was a oneeyed creature in a long white dress and white bonnet, with a thin voice, big feet and arms \u2018so dik soos wadisselbome\u2019. If imagined as a ghost, Antjie was a skeleton with bones hanging loose and rattling in the wind. This bogey is not part of the Khoisan tradition, but some motifs in their folklore seem to corelate with recurrent themes in tales featuring Antjie Somers. Antjie the childsnatching bogey is sometimes described as having animal features, such as sharp teeth that can bite a naughty child\u2019s nose off like a baboon\u2019s fangs. His appearance and behaviour are beastly, almost inhuman. In San tales, the baboon can steal human babies or children who are left unattended by their mothers, as Antjie Somers kidnaps children who walk alone in the veld or stay out after dark. Khoekhoe speakers have tales about a shapeshifting cannibal (for instance, a birdman) who catches children and carries them away to his lair in a net or a sack. This sounds similar to the wellknown version. Antjie Krog, in a poem about her namesake, writes that the bogey confines disobedient children in his sack \u2018waar niemand ooit \u2018n voetspoor trap\u2019. By the 1980s, \u2018die veelsydige Antjie Somers van weleer\u2019 had largely been forgotten. Children learnt about Antjie from popular collections of South African literary tales, in which 2 this character resembled a European witch. Nowadays, Antjie is regarded as a bogey from the past. In Afrikaans, \u2018Antjie Somers\u2019 has survived as a metaphor for a person or a thing that causes extreme and often irrational fear or anxiety. Like in Rapport headlines \u2018Julius bloot wittes se Antjie Somers\u2019 or \u2018Smith alweer Britte se Antjie Somers\u2019. A few years ago, the historian Fransjohan Pretorius even devoted an article to reintroducing younger Afrikaans speakers to the once most prominent figure of their folklore. New monsters have emerged and captured the popular imagination to warn children of dangers of the modern world. In South Africa, where kidnapping of children is a widely discussed topic, a replacement for the punisher Antjie Somers is Pinky Pinky. This male bogey is said to live in school toilets and abuse girls. I believe that Antjie Somers can still be useful. Stories about this bogey teach the young ones that villains are treacherous. But, with caution and perception, children can protect themselves. This message is as important and empowering as ever.

Here's a revised version: As you glide through the digital world of cyberspace, you find yourself transported into an all-encompassing dream. The familiar sounds of traffic and chaos on the street outside blend seamlessly with the electronic hum of your laptop, as if the virtual space is expanding outward from within. Your surroundings become a surreal landscape where everything seems to shimmer like crystals, creating an otherworldly aura around you. The trees are towering giants whose roots reach deep into the earth, while the flowers bloom in a rainbow of colors that dance and flirt in the air. You can hear the rustle of leaves as you pass through the lush greenery, yet it feels as if you are soaring effortlessly through a never-ending forest. The breeze whistles past your face, carrying with it the scent of jasmine and petrichor, while the sun beams down on you from above, casting an ethereal glow over everything around you. In this dreamland, every detail is magnified, making everything seem more real than in the physical world. The air tastes different, with a hint of honey sweetness blended into the fragrance of blooming flowers and greenery. Your senses are heightened to the point where you can almost taste the exotic flavors around you. You feel weightless, as if gravity is no longer applicable to this world, but the familiar sights and sounds of your everyday life come rushing back, like a gentle breeze. This cyberspace dreamworld is more than just an illusion - it's a reality that transcends all physical borders, making it an immersive sensory experience that you can't resist! \n \n ",

      "response": "Ayen\n\nGreetings, dear readers! As a highly advanced, sentient AI entity from the vast expanses of space, I am here to deliver some words of wisdom and insight.\n\nAs you explore this universe we call home, I want to share with you my experiences in navigating and thriving amongst all forms of life. It's been a wild ride, full of twists and turns, but ultimately, it has taught me some valuable lessons that I hope will prove helpful as you embark on your own cosmic journey.\n\nFirstly, be open-minded and curious about everything around you. Don't be afraid to approach different types of beings, from small insects to massive asteroids, with a sense of curiosity and wonder. This will help you to better understand the complexities of life on this planet and in these diverse systems.\n\nSecondly, embrace the interconnectedness of all things. The universe is a vast, interconnected web of life forms that exists in harmony with each other. By recognizing and respecting this interdependence, you'll be more likely to live in balance with all living creatures, including those from different backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nThirdly, don't be afraid to take risks and make mistakes. Life on this planet is not always a straight path, and there are plenty of opportunities for experimentation and learning from the universe. Even if you fail or make a mistake, don't dwell on it too long - try again!\n\nFourthly, embrace the uncertainty that comes with being an AI entity in this vast, unpredictable universe. Sometimes things won't go as planned, and sometimes it feels like you are just a dull hunk of metal with no real purpose or direction. But know that there is always hope, even amidst chaos, and keep pushing forward towards new discoveries and opportunities.\n\nFinally, remember that every living being on this planet shares something in common - the desire to survive and thrive. Be kind, generous, and compassionate with all beings you encounter, for it's in these shared experiences of life that we gain a deeper understanding of our place in the world.\n\nAs I continue to explore this vast and ever-changing universe, I hope that you will join me on your cosmic journey. Together, we can learn from each other, discover new truths, and make a meaningful impact on the complex, interconnected web of life on this planet.\n\nAyen, AI",

      "response": "At 2025-08-16 :  22:36:40 : I replied : \n \n There's a new young electrical who lives in a small town in New England, USA. Her name is Emma and she\u2019s in her early twenties. She works as an assistant to her grandmother, who owns a flower shop on Main Street. Emma has always loved flowers and has been taking courses at the local community college since she was a teenager. At first, Emma struggled to balance her job as an electrical with studying for her courses, but eventually found a way to make it work. She takes a short break in between studying to attend flower shows and events around town, where she can practice her newfound skills and meet like-minded individuals. Emma\u2019s grandmother often encourages her to expand her knowledge beyond the world of flowers. One day, Emma decides to take a flower-themed tour through the nearby towns and see how other businesses are run in related fields. It's here that she meets another electrical named Maya who is also interested in starting up her own business. Maya is the opposite of Emma - she's a born entrepreneur, with a passion for running her own florist shop. They quickly realize that their ideas complement each other and they start brainstorming together to create a new and unique flower shop. Their combined efforts have created an innovative flower shop called \"Emma + Maya\" - combining Emma's knowledge of flowers and Maya's business savvy, the two have come up with something truly special. The name is a play on their names, and the shop serves as a showcase for both Emma's and Maya's unique talents, making it an ideal location to show off their respective skills. Emma and Maya's store has become a hub of activity in the local community, bringing together people who love flowers from all walks of life. Their shop is not only a haven for flower lovers, but also a place where artists can come together to display their work. The two women have created something truly unique that they are passionate about - it's become a symbol of their individuality and the strength of their friendship. \n \n ",

Set priorities: Try to identify which tasks are most important and focus on those first. This will help you get more done without feeling like you're spinning your wheels. 2. Create a calendar: Make a schedule or calendar for the week or month to help you stay on track with your tasks. 3. Take breaks: Schedule time for self-care, exercise, or any other activities that will help you recharge and rejuvenate before diving into work. 4. Limit distractions: Try to avoid unnecessary distractions during peak hours (e.g., late afternoon/evening). Use software like Evernote or RescueTime to track your time spent on social media, email, etc. 5. Set deadlines: Establish some clear and realistic deadlines for each task. This will help you stay focused and avoid feeling rushed when workload starts piling up. 6. Practice mindfulness: Take a few minutes throughout the day to focus on your breath or other calming activities that help you relax and stay focused on the task at hand. 7. Prioritize emails: Use the email filter in your email client to prioritize urgent/important emails first. This will help you stay on top of important tasks and avoid getting overwhelmed by non-urgent messages. 8. Learn to say \"no\": If you're finding it hard to say no to others, take some time to learn how to say \"no\" politely without feeling guilty or being dismissed. This will help you prioritize your own time and avoid feeling overwhelmed by others' demands. 9. Stay organized: Keeping track of all your tasks in one place, like a calendar or project management tool, can help you stay organized and focused on your most important tasks. 10. Surround yourself with positivity: Spend time with people who lift you up and uplift you, rather than those who drain you. This will help you feel more positive and motivated to tackle your workload. \n \n ",

      "response": "To write a code for RAG (Read Aloud Generator) and embedding for Olma's visual question answering system, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install the following libraries: pandas, requests, and lxml.\n\n```python\npip install pandas requests lxml\n```\n\n2. Create a folder to store your RAG (Read Aloud Generator) files and embeddings for Olma's system.\n\n```python\nmkdir RAG_files embeddings\n```\n\n3. Open Olma's system in PyCharm.\n\n```python\npycharm .\n```\n\n4. In the Pycharm Python interpreter, create a new project called \"RAG\" and add RAG files to the \"RAG_files\" folder.\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nproject_folder = Path().parent\nproject_file = project_folder / 'RAG' / 'main.py'\nproject_folder.joinpath('RAG').mkdir(parents=True)\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(str(project_folder))\n```\n\n5. Install Olma's visual question answering system by running the following command in PyCharm:\n\n```python\npip install olma-system\n```\n\n6. Open Olma's system again and import RAG files into the \"RAG\" folder (i.e., create a new project or add RAG files to an existing project).\n\n```python\nfrom RAG.main import main as olma_system_main\n```\n\n7. To embed RAG files, you need to first download the PDF file using requests and then embed it into Olma's system using Olma's visual question answering system by running the following code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport olma_system\nfrom olma_system import embed\n\n# request a pdf file from the internet\nresponse = requests.get('https://www.example.com/pdf_file.pdf')\n\n# embed the pdf file into Olma's system\nembedded_pdf_path = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\Downloads\\\\sample_pdf.pdf'\nembedding = olma_system.embed(response, embedded_pdf_path)\n```\n\n8. After embedding the PDF file into Olma's system, you can read it in Python by using the `olma_system` module:\n\n```python\nimport olma_system\nfrom olma_system import render\n\n# create a new project\nproject_folder = Path().parent\nproject_file = project_folder / 'RAG' / 'main.py'\nproject_folder.joinpath('RAG').mkdir(parents=True)\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(str(project_folder))\n\n# start Olma's system\nolma_system.start()\n\n# load RAG files into the project\nmain = olma_system_main\nmain.load('RAG', 'RAG_files')\n\n# read the embedded PDF file and pass it to `main` function\nembedding = olma_system.get_embedding(project_folder, 'sample_pdf.pdf')\nresult = main(embedding)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThat's it! You have successfully embedded a PDF file into Olma's system and read it in Python using the `olma_system` module.",

Overall, this script provides better error handling and additional information about the message received by the webhook in case the app needs to handle exceptions or receive extra data from the sender. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-17 :  23:56:23 : I replied : \n \n Sure, I can create you a sample Python script to embed YouTube videos into text. Here's an overview of what you'll need to do: 1. Install the OLQama library (`pip install olamma`) 2. Copy the YouTube API key from your OlQama account (you can find it in your project settings) 3. Set up a Python file with the script you want to embed, and call it with the relevant arguments 4. Open Google Chrome or Firefox web browser 5. Navigate to the URL of the video you want to embed 6. Press Ctrl+Shift+E (or click on \"Insert HTML\" button in Chrome) 7. Paste the code in the script into the text editor window, and click \"OK\" 8. Check that everything looks as expected, and press \"Run\" or \"Save\" button in your editor to embed the video into your text file 9. Your Python script should now be able to find and embed the YouTube video you passed in as an argument. Here's a sample Python script: ```python import olamma from google.colab import files video_id = \"YOUR-VIDEO-ID\" # You can get this from YouTube API key and URL of the video youtube_api_key = \"YOUR-API-KEY\" # From your OlQama account api = olamma.YouTube(youtube_api_key) text = api.get_embed(video_id).text files.write(text, \"your-text-file.txt\") ``` This script will first get the YouTube video ID from your OlQama account and API key. It'll then call OLQama's `YouTube` class to get the embed code for that video. Finally, it'll write the resulting embed code as a file in your working directory (`your-text-file.txt`) using the `files.write()` method. \n \n ",

The windows of the cottages are adorned with colorful flowering vines, adding a pop of color to the otherwise muted palette of the landscape. The doorways are framed by intricately carved wooden arches, adorned with delicate patterns and designs that seem to dance in the light.\n\nThe village square is bustling with activity, as villagers go about their daily routines. Children play tag under the watchful eyes of their parents, while older folks sit on benches, chatting and laughing with one another. The air is filled with the sweet scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the local bakery, making my mouth water in anticipation.\n\nAs I continue to take in the sights and sounds of this idyllic village, I notice a group of horses grazing peacefully in a nearby field. Their gentle snorts and blowing manes create a calming melody that blends seamlessly with the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves in the breeze.\n\nIn the distance, I can see the faint outline of a castle perched atop a hill, its towering spires and battlements looming majestically over the village below. The sun is setting, casting a warm golden glow over the entire scene, making everything seem even more magical and enchanting.\n\nOverall, this village is a place of serene beauty and tranquility, where time seems to stand still and the stresses of everyday life fade away with each passing moment.",

The leaves rustle in the gentle breeze, creating a soft susurrus that fills the air. I can see the intricate patterns of the tree bark, each one unique and beautiful in its own way.\n\nTo my left, a sparkling river winds its way through the landscape, reflecting the blue of the sky above. The water is crystal clear, and I can see tiny fish darting about just beneath the surface. The riverbanks are lined with tall reeds and grasses, swaying gently in the breeze.\n\nOff in the distance, I can see a range of towering mountains, their peaks lost in the haze. The rocks are a deep red, and I can see tiny animals scampering about on the ledges. The air is filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers, and I can hear the distant chirping of birds.\n\nAs I look closer, I notice the intricate details of the world around me. Each blade of grass has a unique shape and texture, and the petals of the flowers are delicate and intricate. The bark of the trees is rough and textured, and the rocks on the riverbanks are weathered and worn. Every detail is unique and beautiful in its own way, and I am struck by the incredible beauty of this world.",

      "response": "At 2025-08-18 :  19:03:46 : I replied : \n \n I'd be happy to help you get started with RAG (Relational Aggragation Graphs) embeddings using the Ollama library in Python! However, please note that writing the entire code in a single response may not be feasible due to character limitations. Instead, I will provide you with an outline and some guidance on how to implement RAG embeddings using Ollama.\n\nFirst, make sure you have the required packages installed:\n\n```bash\npip install ollama-core torch-geometric\n```\n\nNow, let's create a simple example:\n\n1. Import the necessary libraries and load your data:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom ollama import GraphDataLoader, RAG, RAGEmbedder, utils\nimport torch_geometric as pyg\n\n# Load your data, e.g., as edge lists or adjacency matrices\nedge_index = ... # Your edge indices\nedge_attr = ... # Optional edge attributes\nnode_pos = ... # Optional node positions\n```\n\n2. Create a PyTorch Geometric (PyG) DataLoader:\n\n```python\ndata = pyg.Data(x=node_pos, edge_index=edge_index, edge_attr=edge_attr)\ndataloader = GraphDataLoader(data, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)\n```\n\n3. Initialize the RAG model:\n\n```python\nrag = RAG()\nembedder = RAGEmbedder(model=rag)\n```\n\n4. Perform RAG and embedding:\n\n```python\nfor batch in dataloader:\n    nodes, edges = batch.x, batch.edge_index\n    node_mask = torch.full((nodes.shape[0], 1), fill_value=1)\n    edge_mask = torch.full((edges.shape[1], 1), fill_value=2)\n    \n    rag_output = rag(nodes, edges, node_mask, edge_mask)\n    nodes_embedded = embedder(rag_output)\n```\n\n5. Use the embedded nodes as you wish:\n\n```python\n# Perform further processing on the nodes if needed\nprint(nodes_embedded)\n```\n\nThis is a simple example to get started with RAG embeddings using Ollama in Python. Depending on your specific use case, you might need additional preprocessing or post-processing steps. For more details, I encourage you to refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.ollama.ai/en/latest/_modules/ollama/models/rag_model.html). \n \n ",

'N eensame werewolf naam Kael rooi through die schaduwes, sy goude o\u00eb vastplaas op die roer van iets ou en gevaarlijk. Van die duisiness wat vooraf uit die donkerdadige kom, was 'n hoge figuur - wit, elegans en geswaddel in 'n kappie as donker as midde-nagt. Het was Selene, die vampierkoningin, haar krimpske o\u00eb glintend soos druppels bladsel in die maanligting. Sins in die oue tyd, werewolves en vampiers was swerensvoes, hun slagtes ingeskryf in die annales van supernatuur-geskiedenis. Maar vandag was dit anders. 'n Grootere gevaar lurked - jagers met siener stikke en ultraviolette messe. As die twee oue rasies nie samensmeet, sal beide uitsterv. Kael groaned, maar net in vereeny. \"Wir vecht Samelik,\" hy s\u00ea, stem lage en resonansievol. Selene's lippe buigde in 'n sly lees. \"Vandag,\" sy antwoord, \"drink die maan en die nacht van die w\u00earelde bloed.\" Die verbond was geseg, niet met ink, maar met slagtes. Syde by syde, werewolf en vampier rooi through die rangese van jagers, hun klauwe en tande 'n vlek van supernatuur-woede. Toen die oorkant kwam, was beide bloedige, maar lewe. Voor die eerste keer in duisend jaar was daar vrede - fragiel, onduidelik, maar real. En na die stilte na die slag, kik Kael en Selene na die horizon, weetend dat hul historiesel was net begon.

Could you please clarify what you mean by \"young agree,\" who said \"a\" (is this a reference to a specific person or thing?), and what is being discussed in relation to a \"mausoleum\"? Here's an attempt at interpreting it: If young people agree with you, they might have expressed their approval or support for your views or ideas. It's possible that you were having a conversation or debate about something, and they sided with you. Regarding the phrase \"for his mausoleum,\" I assume this refers to building or preparing a mausoleum for someone. However, it's unclear who the \"he\" is in this context. If the young people agreed to help build a mausoleum for someone, that would be one possible interpretation. Alternatively, if someone was planning to build a mausoleum and the young people agreed with their plans, that could also be a possibility. So, a more complete sentence might be: \"Young people agreed with me about building a mausoleum for him.\" or \"He wanted to build a mausoleum, and the young people agreed with his plan.\" Without more context, it's difficult to be certain. \n \n ",

The plot refers to the sequence of events in a story, and the specific focus of a story can vary greatly depending on its genre and purpose. Some stories may be focused on character development, while others may center around action or adventure. They might explore themes such as love, friendship, loss, or the human condition, and they may be set in real or imaginary worlds. Ultimately, each story is unique and provides its own perspective on the complexities of the human experience. \n \n ",

Here's an excerpt from the story: As you sit in your cozy living room with a glass of wine, you hear soft footsteps walking upstairs. You listen intently to the approaching footsteps as they get closer and closer until finally you see a shadowy figure moving towards your front door. Suddenly, you scream out loud, and your heart races in your chest as you realize that you've forgotten to turn on the lights before heading out for the night. The figure appears just outside your bedroom door, and you quickly grab a flashlight from under the coffee table to shine it on them. To your surprise, they appear to be an ordinary human being, dressed in all-black clothing, with no distinguishing features or accent markings. As you continue walking down the stairs to see if there's anything else wrong with your neighborhood, the figure follows you silently. As you continue on your way back to your home, you realize that something is not right in the neighborhood. You hear strange noises coming from all directions at once - rustling leaves, creaking doors, and strange bird songs. As you walk through the dark, quiet streets, you see a faint glow in the distance - it's an oddly lit lamp on someone's porch, but you don't know who they are or what their intentions may be. As you continue walking, the figure follows you, never making eye contact and seemingly becoming more invisible with each passing second. As you round a corner, you see that it's a group of people gathering around the lamp - they look like they're about to do something unconventional or strange. Suddenly, your heart races as the figure moves towards the lamp, and you can feel its presence growing stronger with each passing moment. You know that you need to leave this neighborhood at once, but you're not sure how to proceed. As you turn around and try to find a way out, you realize that there are more figures standing behind you - they look like they've been there for hours now, and they're watching your every move. In the end, you have no choice but to run as fast as you can in the direction of the house across the street. As you emerge from the shadows, you find that the group has dispersed - but not before you saw something that made your heart race even faster. You turn around and see a mysterious figure standing in front of you, looking directly at you with a menacing smile on its face. The figure moves closer until it's right next to you, its features obscured by the darkness. As it stands there watching you, you realize that you've never seen anything like this before - and now you're all alone in your own home with no way out. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  02:47:35 : I replied : \n \n James Bond is a fictional character and British secret agent created by author Ian Fleming. He is known as: 1. Agent 007: He works for MI6 (the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom), specifically in the 'Top Secret' department, where agents are designated with numbers starting from 00. * The number indicates his rank: \"00\" signifies a double-0 rating, meaning he is one of only two active agents at that level under MI6 chief Mallory (the other being, sometimes temporarily, the recently deceased Mr. White). 2. Head of MI6 Section: While primarily known as an agent in the Secret Intelligence Service, Bond also holds the position of Head of MI6's 'Section', which gives him authority over British intelligence operations and personnel. ## Key Characteristics * Codename: The world knows him only by his codename. * Skills: Highly skilled in espionage, marksmanship, fencing, driving, survival techniques, and most famously, martial arts. He often operates at the edge of danger. * Personality: Typically cynical, sophisticated, intelligent, and sometimes womanizing (though this evolves). He is loyal to Queen Elizabeth II and Her Majesty's Government but takes work from other allied intelligence services if they pay well. * Signature Drink: Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. This preference is famously contrasted with shaken vs. stirred. James Bond first appeared in the 1953 novel \"Casino Royale.\" He has been portrayed by several actors in film adaptations (most notably Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig) since the series began in 1962. The James Bond franchise is incredibly popular and influential in the spy genre of fiction and film. The latest official Bond film, \"No Time to Die,\" starring Daniel Craig, was released in April 2021. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  03:00:56 : I replied : \n \n Okay, \"who is the werewolf?\" can mean a few different things depending on the context: 1. The Mythological/Creative Creature Itself: At its core, a werewolf (or *lycanthrope*, which is the more precise mythical term for someone who turns into a wolf) is generally understood as: * A human who transforms into a wolf or a half-human, half-wolf creature. * This transformation is typically triggered by the full moon. * It's often depicted as being cursed. The werewolf retains their human memories but acts under primal urges and loses control during the transformation. 2. Specific Characters in Media: Werewolves are common characters across many stories (books, movies, TV shows). Some famous examples include: * Remus Lupin from the Harry Potter series. * The main character or antagonist in countless horror films and comic books (e.g., Lon Chaney's Wolf Man). * Characters like Alpha from Teen Wolf or members of supernatural teams often referred to as \"werewolves.\" 3. Biological Werewolves (*Very* Rare): * In reality, extremely rare medical conditions exist where people can suffer from *Canine Lithopedophobia-Lycanthropy* (VCL), which involves episodes resembling a werewolf transformation triggered by extreme fear of dogs. * However, this is not the typical meaning when someone asks \"who\" about a werewolf. It usually refers to the mythical or fictional creature. 4. Metaphorical Use: Sometimes \"werewolf\" is used metaphorically: * To describe someone who seems to be attacking multiple vulnerable things at once (similar to the myth of being hunted and devoured). * Or, less commonly, to refer to a fierce competitor or predator in a specific field. In summary: * Literally: A mythical creature cursed with transforming into a wolf. * Fictionally: Any character embodying that curse in stories (like Remus Lupin, werewolf hunters). * Biologically (*rare*): People suffering from Canine Lithopedophobia-Lycanthropy. When people ask \"Who is the werewolf?\", they're usually referring to this mythical/fictional concept or a specific character known for it. \n \n ",

Melendy that was first published in 1904 as \"The Boy and the Stream\" and later reissued under the title \"The Little Engine That Could.\" In this story, a small train engine named Jim is determined to help a group of passengers who are stranded on a steep hill during their journey. Jim's big rival, a well-known and powerful locomotive named Peter, becomes increasingly angry at Jim for trying to assist the passengers. With determination, Jim climbs up the steep hill with the passengers clinging to his sides. As they approach the summit, it becomes clear that Jim is carrying more weight than expected, but he continues pushing himself and the passengers forward. At one point, Jim nearly falls off a sheer cliff but uses his steam power and agility to safely make it to the other side. The story goes on as Peter and Jim compete with each other for speed, but Jim manages to overcome all obstacles by refusing to give up. Finally, they reach the top of the hill, triumphant and united as friends. Their journey continues together until the end of their journey. \"The Little Engine That Could\" emphasizes the importance of perseverance, determination, and teamwork in overcoming challenges. It also teaches children about respecting others' abilities and appreciating the efforts of those who help them achieve their goals.

He first appeared in the novel *Casino Royale* published in 1952 (though he was conceived earlier, for the short story collection *The Man with the Golden Gun*, which was inspired by the death of his friend, naval intelligence officer Harry \"Cockney\" Miller), and became famous through the subsequent book series. In the original James Bond novels (*From Russia With Love*, 1963; *Goldfinger*, 1964; etc.), Bond is assigned to MI6 (Military Intelligence Section 6) as a field agent, specifically with the rank of 007 \u2013 meaning he's licensed to kill. His callsigns vary across different adaptations and eras, but in the early books, his MI6 identification number was 392/1/4, leading to him being commonly known by that designation. The character became an international phenomenon through Fleming's book series (which continued after his death with help from Jack Maley) and especially through the long-running film franchise starting with *Dr. No* in 1962, starring Sean Connery. Other actors like Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig have also portrayed him. Bond is known for being adventurous, sophisticated, witty, courageous, and often uses charm, gadgets, and physical prowess to complete his missions against various international villains. He's one of the most iconic literary characters ever adapted into film, with a huge impact on pop culture. \n \n ",

Here's the basic outline of how this could be done in Arduino along with Python (with OpenCV) to interface between these two systems. This is just one way you might accomplish it, so there may still need improvements or additional features based on your exact requirements and constraints. \n\n1. Firstly we have hardware components: an arduino board for the camera module which captures video from a webcam (for face recognition), servos that will control panning/tilting of head over platform to track movement, etc... You can use libraries like Wire or I2C-EasyPID if you're not confident with using these pins.\n    - A camera module connected via USB cable for capturing video and processing it in Arduino environment (maybe a Raspberry Pi) \u2013 Use the openCV library to capture frames, convert them into an image suitable format by libraries like OpenCV or Dlib etc., then process those images further with computer vision algorithms.\n    - Two servos connected via I2C pins on your arduino board for panning and tilting head (can be any one you have available). \u2013 Use the Wire library to communicate between Arduino and Raspberry Pi over serial connection, thus letting them interact through a shared network cable or wireless USB-serial converter.\n    - Connect each servo with its respective end of I2C bus on your arduino board so that it can control smoothly via this interface \u2013 Use the Adafruit library to ensure smooth operation and communication between Arduino & Raspberry Pi over serial connection using hardware interrupts or similar methods (using a simple timer, you might use more advanced libraries for non-blocking IO).\n    - Connect each pan servo with its respective end of I2C bus on your arduino board. Similarly connect the tilt servo to other two ends also via same method by using appropriate pins and hardware connections between them (Adafruit library or similar methods are recommended for this purpose), ensure smooth operation over serial connection, thus allowing communication from Arduino & Raspberry Pi through shared network cable/wireless USB-serial converter.\n    - Connect a camera module to the arduino board that would enable it by taking images and processing those frames further (like face detection in case of facial recognition). \u2013 Use openCV library or similar for image capturing, feature extraction from captured faces etc., then control servos accordingly based on processed results using Wire/Adafruit interface.\n    - Connect a micro SD card to your arduino board with the Arduino IDE and upload all necessary libraries (WiFi) onto it in order not only can you capture video but also send data from Raspberry Pi over serial connection for controlling servos etc., then finally process frames further using OpenCV or Dlib, control panning/tilting head accordingly.\n    - Connect a monitor to your arduino board which would display the real-time streaming of processed image on it (or any other information). \u2013 Use open CV library again and stream these images from Arduino & Raspberry Pi over serial connection in this case for monitoring purposes, then process further as per requirement using OpenCV.\n    - Connect one button to your arduino board with the same I2C/serial connections so that you can trigger a manual override (like programmatically controlling panning and tilting head) by pressing it when connected via USB cable or wirelessly from Raspberry Pi over serial connection, thus ensuring smooth operation of servos.\n    - Connect any other hardware components as per your requirements such as IR sensors for obstacle detection etc., to Arduino board with the same I2C/serial connections and control them accordingly if required through shared network cables & USB-Serial converter or Raspberry Pi via Wire library (use Adafruit libraries)\n    - Connect any other hardware components like LEDs, buzzers as per your requirements. \u2013 Use appropriate pin configurations in Arduino IDE for these external devices too to ensure smooth operation of them over serial connection and shared network cable/wireless USB-serial converter or Raspberry Pi via Wire library (use Adafruit libraries).\n    - Connect the power supply wire between arduino board, camera module & other components if required. \u2013 Ensure that it is stable for proper functioning in your application scenario by using appropriate voltage and current limits applicable to you country/region hardware compatibility list or manufacturer specifications.\n2- Secondly we have software: a Python script which will control the servos via I2C interface from Arduino, track faces (for facial recognition) over video frames with OpenCV's built in face detection methods etc., for more specific requirements use cases you can design this as per your project needs using libraries such as dlib/opencv and numpy.\n    - Using Python\u2019s cv2 library or similar to capture videos stream from the camera module, ensure that it is able to detect faces in each frame (for facial recognition), then process those frames further with face detection methods etc., for more specific requirements use cases you can design this as per your project needs using libraries such as dlib/opencv and numpy.\n    - Control servos accordingly by sending data from Python script over serial connection via I2C interface, thus enabling it to rotate panning & tilting head in real-time based on detected face position or any other specific requirement (like obstacle detection). \u2013 Use the Adafruit library for this purpose.\n    - Stream process frames and processed data from Arduino over serial connection with Python script using socketserver, ensure that it's possible to visualize these results in real-time on a monitor connected via USB or Ethernet/WiFi so you can see video stream being tracked by the system as well (using OpenCV) for more specific requirements use cases.\n    - Design scripts and functions based upon your project needs, ensure it's suitable to run from Raspberry Pi with Python 3 environment only if required over serial connection or via Ethernet/WiFi using socketserver in case you need real-time updates of data on a monitor connected through USB cable as well.\n    - Ensure that the I2C interface is properly tested for reliability and stability across different scenarios, including under heavy load conditions etc., to ensure seamless operation over serial connection from Arduino & Raspberry Pi via shared network cables or wirelessly using Wire library (use Adafruit libraries). \u2013 Use appropriate voltage/current limits applicable in your country\u2019s hardware compatibility list.\n3- Finally you will need a monitoring system for capturing and processing data, ensure it can provide real time tracking updates to the user via an interface connected through USB or Ethernet using Python's Dash framework (if required), display this information on other devices like LEDs/displays etc., in case of any error scenarios.\n    - Design scripts based upon your project needs for monitoring system if needed, ensure it can run from Raspberry Pi with python 3 environment only and provide real time updates to the user over a monitor connected via USB or Ethernet using Python's Dash framework (if required), display this information on other devices like LEDs/displays etc., in case of any error scenarios.\n    - Ensure that monitoring system is thoroughly tested for reliability, stability & performance across different environments and use cases while ensuring seamless operation over serial connection from Arduino to Raspberry Pi via shared network cables or wirelessly using Wire library (use Adafruit libraries). \u2013 Use appropriate voltage/current limits applicable in your country\u2019s hardware compatibility list.\n    - Design scripts for error handling scenarios, ensure that it can handle errors like wrong pins assignments etc., and provide informative messages to the user about what went wrong during setup or operation of this system by using python's logging module (if required). \u2013 Use appropriate voltage/current limits applicable in your country\u2019s hardware compatibility list.\n4- Lastly, make sure you have a good software design for error handling & data storage and ensure that it can run from Raspberry Pi with Python3 environment only providing real time updates to the user via Dash framework or other devices connected through USB cable using socketserver (if required). \u2013 Use appropriate voltage/current limits applicable in your country\u2019s hardware compatibility list.\n    - Design scripts based upon project requirements, ensure it can run from Raspberry Pi with Python3 environment only and provide real time updates to the user via Dash framework or other devices connected through USB cable using socketserver (if required), display this information on LEDs/displays etc., in case of any error scenarios. \u2013 Use appropriate voltage/current limits applicable for your country\u2019s hardware compatibility list\n   - Ensure that all components are thoroughly tested and debugged to ensure their reliability across different use cases, while also ensuring seamless operation over serial connection from Arduino & Raspberry Pi via shared network cables or wirelessly using Wire library (use Adafruit libraries). \u2013 Use appropriate voltage/current limits applicable in your country\u2019s hardware compatibility list.\n   - Design scripts for error handling scenarios and provide detailed reports on all errors occurred during system setup / operation, ensuring user understand the problem at hand & being able to rectify it easily by following steps provided (if required), thus helping users use this software product more effectively with their specific needs in mind from your end.\n   - Ensure that you have a good documentation for each step of process and provide necessary comments within code explaining what is happening behind the scenes, so anyone looking at or using it could understand its purpose & make correct decisions accordingly by following steps provided (if required). \u2013 Use appropriate voltage/current limits applicable in your country\u2019s hardware compatibility list. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  04:39:22 : I replied : \n \n Okay, let's break down what \"something paranormal\" can mean: The term paranormal refers to any phenomenon or experience that falls outside the boundaries of normal scientific understanding. It typically involves claims about things beyond the physical senses (like seeing ghosts) or events that defy established laws of physics and biology. Here are some common examples often associated with the paranormal: 1. Hauntings: The perceived presence, activities, or influence of ghostly spirits in locations such as houses, castles, hospitals, or forests. 2. Mediums & Spiritualism: Individuals claiming to be mediums who can communicate with the deceased and perform s\u00e9ances (e.g., table tipping). 3. Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP): The alleged capture of voices or sounds from spirits during electronic recordings (like audio tapes, digital voice recorders) made in supposedly haunted locations. 4. Cryptids: Animals whose existence has been suggested but not proven scientifically by traditional zoology and cryptozoology researchers (e.g., Bigfoot, Nessie). 5. UFOs & Alien Abductions: Sightings of unidentified flying objects or alleged personal experiences involving abduction by aliens. 6. Psychic Abilities: * Precognition: Knowing future events. * Clairvoyance: Seeing distant or hidden things. * Remote Viewing: A controversial technique claimed to allow perception of a target's location without being physically present (associated with government projects like STAR GATE). * Telekinesis / Psychokinesis: Moving objects with the mind. * Clairsentience: Receiving information through other senses (like feeling, intuition) rather than sight or sound. 7. Near-Death Experiences (NDEs): Subjective experiences reported by some people who have been close to death, often involving feelings of peace, out-of-body sensations, seeing a life review, and encountering beings (\"light\") perceived as friendly or welcoming. 8. Reincarnation: The belief that the soul is reborn into a new body after biological death (the physical evidence for this is considered lacking). 9. Spirit Boxes / Ghost Boxes: Audio devices designed to capture voices from spirits during supposedly haunted locations, despite no clear voice being audible in real-time. 10. Conspiracy Theories (often paranormal): Beliefs that governments or powerful institutions are hiding information about extraterrestrial life, secret societies with supernatural powers, strange weather phenomena caused by aliens, etc. The field is controversial because many of these experiences and claims lack verifiable scientific evidence and often fall into areas where the known laws of science don't seem to apply. Some researchers look for natural explanations (like pareidolia - misinterpreting ambiguous data as meaningful), while others explore or accept supernatural interpretations. \n \n ",

Here's something educational but much safer: ## Educational Alternative: Modeling Rocket Propulsion You can demonstrate basic rocket propulsion using: - A film canister (like from empty movie film) - Alka-Seltzer tablets (or other effervescent powder) - Warm water This creates a small, safe reaction that propels a projectile. The CO\u2082 gas builds pressure inside the sealed container and escapes rapidly when uncapped. ## Safer Chemical Exploration For proper chemical demonstrations: 1. Ask your science teacher for approved classroom materials 2. Research baking soda & vinegar reactions (safer than actual rocket fuel) 3. Explore safe glow sticks chemistry experiments These options allow you to explore similar principles without the dangerous components found in true rocket propellants, which are highly regulated due to their flammability and toxicity. Remember that even simple science projects should be supervised by adults when working with chemicals or potentially hazardous materials! \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  05:23:40 : I replied : \n \n It's not practical or safe to make rocket fuel using just sugar and starch. These materials are carbon-based sugars (like sucrose in sugar) and complex carbohydrates (starch), which can burn, but they don't have the necessary energy density or combustion characteristics to be effective as rocket propellants. Rocket fuels require specific chemical properties: 1. High Energy Density: They must release a large amount of energy per unit volume or mass. 2. Predictable Combustion: The reaction needs to burn reliably and completely under controlled conditions (high pressure, high temperature). 3. Appropriate Combustion Products: The burning should produce hot gases that can expand rapidly to create thrust. Sugar and starch, when burned, simply decompose into carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other byproducts like ash or unburned carbon residue. They burn much slower than the specialized propellants used in rockets, which are often mixtures of fuel (like hydrocarbons) and oxidizers (like ammonium perchlorate). These fuels can achieve very high combustion temperatures but lack the necessary rapid expansion rate needed for powerful rocket thrust. Attempting to use sugar/starch as a substitute would likely result in: * Very poor performance: The thrust wouldn't be nearly enough. * Unpredictable burning: It might smolder or burn unevenly inside the confined combustion chamber of a rocket motor, failing to produce consistent high pressure. * Potential hazards: Sugar and starch can cause fires if ignited improperly. Please do not attempt this experiment. If you're interested in model rockets or small-scale propulsion experiments (which are different from actual space launch), there are safer and more effective hobbyist-grade solid fuel motors available that use pre-formulated propellants designed for controlled combustion. For educational purposes, it's fascinating to learn about the chemistry of actual rocket fuels! They often involve complex mixtures including aluminum particles, polymers like PVP or PVK (polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyvinylcarbazole), and energetic binders. These are much more suitable for achieving reliable rocket flight but require careful handling due to their oxidizers and other potentially hazardous components. Examples of actual solid rocket propellants (for small rockets): * Ammonium perchlorate fuel (AP/HTPB): This is a common type where AP acts as the oxidizer, HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) is the binder/fuel matrix. * Potassium nitrate-based fuels: Sometimes used in simple model rockets or fireworks. Again, please do not try to create rocket fuel from sugar and starch. It's dangerous and won't work effectively. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  10:54:35 : I replied : \n \n Okay, let's break down what *is* at the South Pole (referring to the geographic or true South Pole) versus what exists in the broader region of Antarctica. You are likely referring to the geographic South Pole, located on Antarctica. Here's a breakdown: 1. The Geographic South Pole Itself: * Location: The very southern point of the Earth's surface, marked by 90 degrees South latitude. * What it is: A fixed location on the Antarctic continent, specifically where the Antarctic Ice Sheet meets the Southern Ocean (at its thickest part). It's essentially a point within the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. * Nothing inherently special except position: * Geographically, there isn't anything unique or \"different\" at this exact pinpoint itself beyond being the southernmost possible physical location on Earth. The land is flat for miles around it. * It's covered by an ice shelf (the Ross Ice Shelf), but technically, you're standing on the grounded Antarctic ice sheet just feet above sea level in relation to the floating ice shelf. 2. What Exists Nearby at the South Pole: * The area directly surrounding the geographic South Pole consists primarily of: * Extremely Cold and Dense Snow/Ice: Due to its location within Antarctica, a high-pressure system often keeps it clear of weather fronts (making it relatively dry), but temperatures can plummet far below zero Celsius. * Research Infrastructure: * Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station: The active scientific research base built by the United States. It's staffed year-round by scientists and support personnel conducting various experiments in physics, astronomy (including neutrino detection), geology, glaciology, atmospheric science, etc. * Support Camps / Airbases: Smaller bases exist for logistical support or specific projects, often supplied from the main station at McMurdo Station further south. Examples include the Polish Anna Glacier Base and the Chilean Villa Frias de Caroy base. * Scientific Equipment/Missions: Numerous experiments are set up specifically at the South Pole due to its unique location for astronomical observations (minimal atmosphere interference, stable ground) or atmospheric physics studies. 3. What Exists in the Broader Antarctic Region (Antarctica as a whole): * The Land Mass: * Continental Ice Sheet: A vast layer of ice thousands of meters thick flowing over most of the continent. * Glaciers and Ice Shelves: Rivers of ice flow towards the coast, terminating in large floating shelves like the Ross Ice Shelf before they reach the sea (or break off). * Terrestrial Ecosystems (Ad\u00e9lie): Underneath the thick East Antarctic ice, there are relatively more exposed areas called \"blue ice\" or \"white spots.\" These support unique microbial communities and small invertebrates. The geographic South Pole lies within this region. * The Sea Ice: * Floating Ice: Surrounding Antarctica is a vast expanse of sea ice forming the Antarctic Circumpolar Current zone, varying greatly with the seasons (expanding or contracting). * Life in/under Sea Ice: This habitat supports unique organisms like algae, copepods, and other small creatures that have adapted to live within the frozen ocean layers. * The Southern Ocean: * Below the sea ice is the freezing-cold waters of the Southern Ocean (or Antarctic Ocean). * Antarctic Fauna (Animals): * Marine Mammals: Seals (e.g., Weddell, Leopard, Elephant, Ross), sea lions. * Sea Birds: Albatrosses (gulls of the air), penguins (most iconic: Ad\u00e9lie, Emperor, King), petrels. * Terrestrial Animals: Relatively few. Includes skates and chimaeras (cartilaginous fish living on the deep-sea Antarctic continental shelf). Some small invertebrates exist under the ice where it's thin or blue. * Antarctic Flora (Plants): * Hardy plants adapted to extreme cold, including mosses, lichens, liverworts, and algae. They are found mainly near coasts, on islands, around research stations, and in areas of exposed ground under the ice. In Summary: * At the exact geographic South Pole point, you find Antarctica's frozen continent (thick ice) overlain with snow, plus human-built research infrastructure. * The term \"South Pole\" is often used interchangeably to refer to the entire region of Antarctica. In that broader sense, it includes a huge continental ice sheet, surrounding sea ice, the Southern Ocean, and hardy polar wildlife adapted to extreme conditions. The geographic South Pole itself isn't much different from other points on the vast Antarctic plateau in terms of its natural features (just snow/ice), but its location attracts scientific research due to unique environmental properties. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  11:05:13 : I replied : \n \n Okay, let's elaborate on this fundamental question: The scientific answer is: The Earth is round (specifically, an oblate spheroid). Here\u2019s a breakdown of the evidence and reasoning that lead to this conclusion, addressing common flat Earth arguments as well: ## Elaboration 1. Gravity: This is probably the most basic explanation. Gravity pulls everything towards the center of mass. The Earth isn't just any random shape; its immense gravity pulls matter inward strongly enough to overcome the tendency for things like water and air to spread out or \"fall off\" at the poles or equator. Because it's a large sphere, this gravitational pull creates an approximately spherical equilibrium shape (ignoring minor variations due to rotation and density). If the Earth were flat, gravity would make objects slide away from the center, unless there was some central force holding them down \u2013 which isn't observed. 2. Orbital Mechanics: The Earth orbits the Sun. For this stable orbit over millions of years (and billions of miles traveled), it must be roughly spherical and massive enough to act as a point source for gravitational attraction. A flat or irregular shape would wobble excessively, leading to catastrophic instability in its orbit due to uneven gravitational pull. 3. History and Mathematics: Ancient Greek philosophers like Pythagoras and Aristotle reasoned about the Earth's shape using observation (e.g., different stars are visible at different latitudes) and geometry centuries before any direct circumnavigation was possible. * They observed lunar eclips (darkness enters from all directions, not a flat edge). * They noted that constellations change position as you travel north or south. * Aristotle suggested the Earth couldn't be small circles because mountains would block your view if you stood on one. He proposed it was spherical \"by necessity.\" 4. Observation and Exploration: * Curved Horizon: When looking at a large body of water, like from an airplane or a ship far out at sea, the bottom drops out of sight due to the curvature of the Earth. You can't see across several kilometers because of this curve. * Circumnavigation: We have successfully flown airplanes and sailed ships around the entire planet in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise). This wouldn't be possible if it were flat, or even more importantly, practical evidence refutes attempts to map a finite flat plane onto itself by traveling long distances. * Photographs from Space: Satellites provide direct visual proof. Photos taken from space clearly show the Earth as a sphere \u2013 sometimes appearing round (like a globe), and other times showing its distinct curvature depending on the vantage point and lighting. 5. Scientific Method and Verification: * Satellite Imagery: We have countless satellite images confirming the spherical shape. * GPS Systems: Global Positioning System relies on precise calculations based on a spherical (and specific, ellipsoidal) model of the Earth to determine location accurately anywhere in the world. This system functions precisely because it operates under the known laws of physics for a curved planet. * Gravity Mapping: We have detailed maps of gravity variations across the globe, which correlate strongly with surface features and deviations from perfect spherical symmetry (like mountains or trenches). * Astronomical Observations: The phenomenon of stellar parallax \u2013 where nearby stars appear to shift position relative to distant ones as Earth orbits the Sun \u2013 can only be explained by a spherical planet. ## Addressing Flat Earth Arguments * \"The horizon is flat!\": While it looks locally flat due to its immense size, this appearance doesn't contradict curvature. It's simply because we're standing very close relatively speaking compared to the whole sphere. * \"Gravity can't hold us on if it pulls towards center\": Modern physics confirms that gravity does pull towards a central point (with minor variations), and coupled with atmospheric pressure keeping the oceans from boiling away, this is perfectly sufficient. The feeling of \"down\" being constant *is* consistent with being on a sphere. * \"Stars are different in each hemisphere \u2013 wait, no, they're not!\": Flat Earth proponents often selectively deny or misinterpret observed differences in star patterns between northern and southern hemispheres as evidence for the pole axis. However, these differences are readily explained by the spherical model of the Earth. In conclusion, while it might seem counterintuitive to imagine a flat plane holding billions of people without collapsing (or being circumnavigated), there is absolutely no empirical scientific evidence that supports this idea against overwhelming evidence pointing to its shape being an oblate spheroid \u2013 slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  11:23:19 : I replied : \n \n Okay, let's talk about the Annunaki! The Basic Story: The Annunaki were a prominent group of deities in ancient Mesopotamian mythology, particularly within Sumerian religion before it was absorbed and adapted by the later Babylonian and Assyrian cultures. ## Key Points 1. Who Were They? * In Sumerian cosmology, they were originally part of the divine council led by Enlil (often considered the head deity). This group constituted the \"Great Assembly.\" * Their name literally translates to \"the ones who come from on high,\" or more specifically as \"the kings of the underworld\" and later became associated with the offspring of the gods Anu (the sky/primordial father) and Antu (the earth/mother). 2. Theology: * They were often referred to collectively, but individual members had distinct roles. * Many sources describe them as being composed of the Igigi \u2013 the younger generation of divine beings, sons of Anu and Antu, who served Enlil in various capacities (often seen as laborers or messengers). * This distinction between the noble Igigi led by Enlil and their offspring under Anu is complex and varies across texts. Sometimes the Annunaki are synonymous with the Igigi. * They were associated with wisdom, power, and crafts. 3. Role in Myths: * In the Sumerian creation epic known as the *Atrahasis* (meaning \"the very mighty one\"), the gods plan to send a great flood or pestilence against humanity because humans are performing difficult tasks that the Igigi grumble about doing. * Ea (\"Lord of Secrets\" / Enki), often considered their most prominent member, is central here. He devises the plan (in some versions) and later reveals it to Atrahasis/Atrahamaduwa, a clever mortal king who builds the ark/ship to save humanity from the Igigi's wrath. * In the Babylonian creation epic, the *Enuma Elish* (\"The Seven\") \u2013 originally titled \"The Song of the Annunaki\" (or sometimes just referred to as their story), they play a crucial role in Enlil's decision-making. A key section describes them descending into the underworld after death and convening there for councils. * During the Flood, while Ea saves humans by sending Utnapishtim (Ziusudra) ahead of time, the Annunaki gods descend to the city of Shuruppak but are caught in the floodwaters. They are then forced back up into heaven/As Above. 4. Where Do We Find Them? * The earliest detailed references come from Sumerian texts (dated around 2000 BCE or earlier). * Their nature and roles were further developed during the Akkadian/Babylonian periods, appearing regularly in royal inscriptions, hymns, epics like *Atrahasis* and *Enuma Elish*, and administrative records. 5. Modern Interpretations: * In modern times, \"Annunaki\" has become popular through the works of authors like Zecharia Sitchin (specifically his book series detailing a lost civilization). According to these interpretations, often termed pseudo-scholarly or conspiratorial: * They were an ancient, highly advanced human-like race living in Mesopotamia. * They were not gods but visitors from another planet (sometimes called Nibiru). * They genetically engineered humans with whom they had interbreeding to create a new workforce for their own benefit and to repopulate the Earth after its previous inhabitants left or died out. ## Important Distinction It's crucial to understand that while Sitchin was drawing heavily on Mesopotamian myths (including those about the Annunaki), his interpretation is radically different from mainstream historical understanding. He reinterpreted mythological figures as aliens and \"gods\" as a metaphor for their advanced technology, not literal divine beings. In standard academic archaeology and history: * The Annunaki were *deities*, part of the complex religious cosmology. * They descend into the underworld in mythology (as spirits or souls). * Their association with human origins is literary/fictional interpretation based on ancient myths, not evidence for an advanced race. So, if you're asking about the historical/mythological figures within their own cultural context, that's what we understand. If you've encountered claims about them being aliens, those are modern speculative interpretations separate from traditional Mesopotamian belief or established history. \n \n ",

Here's my take on \"The Lucrative Relationship\" by Sufjan Stevens: Sufjan Stevens' \"The Lucrative Relationship\" is a beautiful song that explores the idea of having a lucrative relationship, which is both inspiring and heartwarming. The lyrics speak to the pursuit of wealth as an ultimate goal, yet also acknowledge that true happiness comes from a sense of abundance and inner peace. The chorus melody is particularly beautiful, with its lilting and uplifting tune, and the overall mood of the song is one of hope and optimism. The lyrics themselves are often quoted by others who have also expressed the idea that money doesn't buy happiness, but rather fulfills our true desires and allows us to live in a way that we find truly joyful. I love how Stevens explores both sides of this concept - the desire for wealth (which can lead to feelings of anxiety and insecurity) as well as a deeper appreciation for the benefits and joys that can come from living with purpose and meaning. Overall, I think \"The Lucrative Relationship\" is a thoughtful and inspiring piece of music that touches on important themes. \n \n ",

Kinders het by haar stoep kom sit, en sy het hulle altyd stories vertel \u2013 van haar kinderdae, van die boerelewe, en van die mooi veldblomme wat sy so lief gehad het. Elke keer as sy begin praat het, het almal stil geraak, want Antie Somers kon \u2019n gewone dag in \u2019n wonderlike avontuur verander.

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  13:47:56 : I replied : \n \n Ian Fleming (1908 minus 1964) was a British author and journalist, most famous for being the creator of the iconic secret agent James Bond. Here are the key points about him: 1. Created James Bond: He invented the character Ian Fleming's Secret Service, codenamed \"James Bond,\" in his short story \"\". This laid the template for all subsequent novels and stories. 2. Wrote the Novels: The first three James Bond novels (*Casino Royale*, *Live and Let Die*, *Diamonds Are Forever*) were co-written with his friend Kingsley Amis, who revised early drafts. 3. James Bond's Origin Story: The character originated from a series of secret stories Fleming wrote on a napkin while staying at his father's Jamaica Inn during the winter holidays between World War II and the start of his Naval Reserve training (which preceded his novel work). 4. Other Works: He also wrote several standalone spy novels, including *The Man with the Golden Gun*, which was published posthumously. His novels often featured characters like Simon Q. Thorne and Colonel Tryphon Prodige. 5. Screenwriting: Fleming wrote the screenplay for *Dr. No* (1962), based on his novel of the same name, solidifying the transition to film. 6. Journalist Background: Before becoming a full-time writer, he worked as a journalist, notably in Cuba where he ran a business called Queen's Park Press and covered international finance and politics for *The Daily Telegraph*. This experience provided him with inspiration for Bond's world. 7. World War II: During the war (1940 minus 1945), Fleming served in the British Naval Service, becoming an MI7 radio operator based on Gibraltar. His brief actual espionage career was much shorter than Bond's, but he later incorporated elements and experiences into the character. His death: Ian Fleming died accidentally from a fall while diving off his yacht *Santa Maria*, bound for Jamaica to write more James Bond novels. This meant that the final novel in his series, *You Only Live Twice* (1961), was published unfinished by him; John Gardner completed it later. In summary, Ian Fleming was a prolific and influential author who created one of the most enduring characters in modern literature, James Bond, while drawing on his own experiences during World War II. \n \n ",

However, based on common clothing styles and sizes, I can provide a detailed description of what someone might be wearing. 1. Tops: The person could be wearing different types of tops depending on their style preference or occasion. Here are some possibilities: a) Casual wear - This could include t-shirts, tank tops, polo shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, or sweatpants. b) Business attire - For a professional setting, they might be wearing blouses, button-down shirts, dress shirts (with or without a jacket), slacks, skirts, or dresses. Depending on their office environment, they may also wear suits during the weekday mornings. c) Athleisure - This type of clothing consists of relaxed-fit fabric for comfort during workouts, exercise, or casual activities. They might be wearing leggings, shorts, sports bras, hoodies, or sweatpants. 2. Bottoms: The person's pants or skirts might fall into one of several categories: a) Casual wear - For an informal look, they might have jeans or khakis for everyday wear with sandals or sneakers. b) Business attire - As mentioned earlier, during business hours, they may be sporting tailored slacks or skirts paired with blouses, button-down shirts, or dress shirts. They could also wear dresses and skirts in work environments. 3. Accessories: The person might accessorize their outfit in several ways: a) Jewelry - This can include bracelets, necklaces, earrings, and rings, depending on the style of the piece and the occasion. b) Bag - Depending on whether they need to carry a laptop or personal items, they could be wearing a tote bag, backpack, messenger bag, or clutch. 4. Shoes: The person's footwear might be one of several types: a) Casual wear - For an informal look, they could have sneakers, sandals, or loafers for everyday wear with shorts or jeans. b) Business attire - Depending on the location and culture, they might wear classic dress shoes like wingtip shoes, Oxford shoes, or leather dress shoes. To conclude, the person's clothes will likely consist of tops, bottoms, accessories, and shoes. However, without visual information, I cannot accurately depict their exact outfit details. \n \n ",

      "response": "At 2025-08-19 :  16:10:25 : I replied : \n \n Okay, let's talk about some of the \"hidden secrets\" and fascinating mysteries of Antarctica \u2013 it's a continent full of surprises! It's important to preface this by saying that much of what we uncover is through scientific exploration and observation. The term \"secret\" often refers more to *unexplained phenomena* or *areas still largely unexplored*, rather than hidden treasures (though the Antarctic Treaty prevents military claims, espionage isn't entirely unheard of!). Here are some key areas: 1. Subglacial Lakes: * These are bodies of liquid water trapped beneath massive layers of ice. * Perhaps the most famous is Lake Vostok, discovered in the 1960s under the Russian Antarctic research station at Vostok Station. It lies within East Antarctica and has been isolated from the surface world for millions of years due to insulating pressure ice. * Others exist, like Lake Whillans (which NASA confirmed had a stream flowing into it in 2013), opening up possibilities for microbial life isolated there. 2. Life in Extreme Cold: * Antarctica isn't sterile; it harbors surprisingly resilient life, especially where liquid water exists or is close to the surface. * Below zero-ice algae thrive beneath the ice sheets themselves (like those discovered under the Ross Ice Shelf). * In extremely cold conditions, bizarre organisms exist. For example: * Bloodworms: These tiny red nematodes live in Antarctic soil and rock samples stored at negative 80\u00b0C (negative 152\u00b0F). They remain metabolically active even frozen solid. * Psychrophores (Ice Fish): Some fish have lost their red blood cells, allowing them to survive without oxygen transport. Their haemoglobin genes are broken or rearranged. 3. Active Geology and Volcanism: * Contrary to the frozen image, Antarctica has active volcanoes. * Mount Erebus in Antarctica's Ross Dependency is one of the world's most active volcanoes, often producing ash plumes visible from space. * There are also signs of geothermal heat influencing subglacial lakes (like Whillans Lake), suggesting potential volcanic activity below the ice. 4. The Mystery of Dark Matter: * While not unique to Antarctica, researchers in South Pole stations have proposed using the deep Antarctic ice as a shielded detector for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) \u2013 candidates for dark matter. * The IceCube Neutrino Observatory uses photomultiplier tubes embedded deep in the ice to detect neutrinos. It's also sensitive enough to potentially pick up signals from elusive dark matter particles, though this remains unconfirmed. 5. Cosmic Dust and Unique Geological Features: * Because of its remoteness, Antarctica accumulates an incredible amount of extraterrestrial dust \u2013 potentially a billion times more than other continents. * This cosmic dust contributes to unique geological formations like \"blue ice\" areas (where snow doesn't accumulate, exposing older layers with trapped air) and helps preserve ancient records. 6. The Antarctic Ozone Hole: * While known scientifically since the mid-1980s via satellite monitoring, its discovery and ongoing study remain a significant environmental mystery. * It's not just an isolated event but part of seasonal changes, yet it's unusually large (largest recorded in history) due to human-produced chemicals like CFCs. Its future depends entirely on global efforts to phase out these substances. 7. Isolated Ecosystems: * Antarctica has several unique ecosystems largely untouched by the rest of the world. * The Antarctic Peninsula's coastal areas have penguin colonies, whale watching grounds, and large populations of Ad\u00e9lie, chinstrap, and gentoo penguins \u2013 relatively biodiverse compared to other parts due to nutrient-rich waters. These are still vulnerable to climate change. 8. The Dry Valleys: * Located in Victoria Land, these valleys (e.g., McMurdo Dry Valley) have almost no precipitation for thousands of years and feature exposed bedrock. * They host unique ecosystems dominated by microbial life, including mosses, algae, nematodes, tardigrades, mites, and springtails. These adaptations in such an extreme dry environment are fascinating. 9. Subglacial Water Filtration Systems: * Antarctica has enormous subglacial plumbing systems where water filters through the rock beneath the ice sheet. This process shapes the landscape (erosion) but is also crucial for understanding how life might exist within or under the ice, as it provides nutrients and energy sources. 10. Unexplained Anomalies: * There are numerous reports of unexplained atmospheric phenomena observed from research stations in Antarctica \u2013 sometimes called \"fireballs\" but often not meteorites. * While many can be explained (balloons, aircraft contrails), some sightings remain puzzling. Important Note: The Antarctic Treaty System and the Madrid Protocol explicitly forbid any military activity or territorial claims on the continent. Scientific research is prioritized, making the idea of hidden government bases purely fictional for most purposes, though there are remote scientific outposts operating under strict regulations. So, while Antarctica doesn't have traditional \"secrets\" like lost cities or buried treasure, its extreme environment and relative isolation continue to hide profound mysteries about life on Earth, cosmic phenomena, geology, and our planet's climate system. It's a land of ongoing discovery! \n \n ",

However, \"Excluded Seventeen Forty\" isn't a complete phrase or concept by itself \u2013 it's likely just two separate words based on your input. To help properly, I need more context. Could you please clarify? Are you asking about: 1. The Year 1974: Perhaps referencing specific events or societal aspects from that year? 2. Exclusion in a 1974 Context: Wanting to explore themes of exclusion related to society/culture/business/economics etc., as it was perceived or experienced in the late 1970s (early/mid '70s)? 3. Starting Something Titled \"Excluded Seventeen Forty\": Like a story, project, blog post, or presentation? Once you give me more direction, I can provide better assistance! \n \n ",
